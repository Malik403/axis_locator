# axis_locator
This script is to locate the axis of where you want a Tkinter application (Made it for my Mute_Checker) Link: https://github.com/Malik403/Mute_Checker


This script includes the x, y, negativex, and negative y axis of your screen. This will print the axis so you can just copy and paste it inside of the Mute Checker script.

(How-To:)
Note: negative x and y are there for people with left side monitors or monitors on the top.

* Set one variable to True (x axis, y axis, negative x axis, or negative y axis)
  
* When you run it a Tkinter GUI should pop up. If you hit the X button at the top, it will open again but in a different position - it will then print the position.

* If you have multiple monitors - I'd recommend putting the monitor you want the notification to show up as primary (When it switches monitors as you keep increasing the axis, it messes up the axis). When you add it to primary, "0+0" will be on the primary monitor and you can then move it to your liking!

* Copy and paste those x and y axis and you have your notification showing up where you want it to!
